# Linked Open Data project at the BCUL

Pilot project to define a metadata application profile to link together the BCUL's various collecting databases. 

## About

This project's aim is to explore how Linked Open Data can be leveraged to bring data from different sources into a single ontology and facilitate the linking of the BCUL's collections to external resources.

### Collecting databases 
* Main bibliographic database
  - **Source data**: MARCXML
* Dital archive for legal deposit, images and press publications
  - **Source data**: Dublin Core

### Topic
Selected resources relating to Laurent Pizzotti, local illustrator and graphic designer. This focus point defines a limited set of data to work with for a pilot project limited in time. 

### Output for the project
Metadata Application Profile that defines a contextualised ontology to be used for future projects with a wider scope.
